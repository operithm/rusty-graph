### **Preface**

- Who This Book Is For
- Why Graph Algorithms?
- Why Rust?
- Why This Book?
- How This Book Is Structured
- How to Use This Book

### **Part I: Foundations of Graph Theory**

#### **Chapter 1: Introduction to Graphs**

- What is a Graph?
- Types of Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted, Cyclic, Acyclic, etc.)
- Common Graph Representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, Edge List)
- Graph Properties (Degree, Path, Cycle, Connectivity, etc.)

#### Chapter 2: Graph Representation in Rust

- **Why Rust for Graphs?**
  - Memory safety for complex graph structures
  - Performance benchmarks vs. Python/C++
- **Implementing Adjacency Lists**
  - Using `Vec<Vec<usize>>` for unweighted graphs
  - `HashMap<u32, Vec<(u32, f64)>>` for weighted graphs
- **Struct-Based Designs**
  - `Node` and `Edge` structs with `#[derive]` traits
  - Example: Building a social network graph
- **Tradeoffs**
  - When to use adjacency matrix vs. list
  - Memory optimizations (e.g., `SmallVec` for small graphs)
- **Generic Implementation**
  - Write a *single* graph implementation that works for:
    - Any node type (`String`, `u32`, custom `struct`).
    - Any edge weight (`i32`, `f64`, or even complex types).
  - Create a *generic* graph `struct` , `trait` bounds for usability, and specializing for common cases.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - Recursive vs. iterative implementations
  - Traversal: pre-order, in-order, post-order, and more
